# HuMobi
 
This is HuMobi library. It is a dedicated Python library for human mobility data processing. It mostly extends Pandas
DataFrames and Geopandas GeoDataFrames. Check three example files for data_aggregation, data_preprocessing, and
data_statistics.

The basic class is TrajectoriesFrame - used to load and store the mobility data. You will find that class in the
structures directory.

Measures contains individual and collective measures for human mobility.
Misc contains useful functions for data processing.
Models contains human mobility models. Currently under development.
Predictors contains next-place prediction methods, Markov Chains, deep-learning and shallow-learning models.
Preprocessing contains methods for data aggregation and filtering.
Tools contains useful tools for data processing.
